The comparison of the outcome of GWAS performed on PCA- and CoMA-derived features reveals that the latter method encounters several significant associations with the genotype; in contrast, PCA, despite its comparable reconstruction performance, yields none. % In other words, CoMA allows extracting phenotypes with some level of heritability.

CoMA experiments and subsequent GWAS were carried out using scaled and unscaled meshes. In both cases, results for $n_z=8$ are reported in the main text. Our results suggest that the Kullback-Leibler regularisation term in the loss function is effective when it comes to obtaining interpretable and heritable low-dimensional representations. Indeed, the experiments performed with non-variational CoMA produced no significant association on the GWAS; with the variational CoMA we found shape latent variables with a significant genetic signal. These results are described in the following.

For scaled meshes, the variational CoMA yielded a latent variable, which we will call $z_0$, with a single Bonferroni-significant genetic locus in chromosome 6 ($p=10^{-18}$). The associated Manhattan plots are shown in figure \ref{fig:manhattan_LV_latent}, along with the corresponding change in shape produced by the latent variable tested. The morphological impact of $z_0$ can be seen to be associated with the sphericity of the LV. The seven remaining latent variables yielded no significant association on the GWAS.

%(sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase)which transports calcium from the cytosol into the SR1. 
%In its dephosphorylated state, PLN lowers the affinity of SERCA for Ca$^{2+}$, thereby inhibiting calcium uptake. Phosphorylation of PLN at serine 16 by PKA (protein kinase A) or threonine 17 by CaMKII (Ca$^{2+}$/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) relieves PLN-mediated inhibition of SERCA, thereby increasing SERCA activity and subsequent uptake of calcium. 
We have been able to map this association to gene PLN (phospholamban) with high confidence, based on the literature on genetics of cardiac phenotypes. 
PLN plays a crucial role in cardiomyocyte calcium handling by acting as a primary regulator of the SERCA protein (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase), which transports calcium from the cytosol into the SR1. In its dephosphorylated state, PLN lowers the affinity of SERCA for Ca$^{2+}$, thereby inhibiting calcium uptake. Phosphorylation of PLN at serine 16 by PKA (protein kinase A) or threonine 17 by CaMKII (Ca$^{2+}$/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) relieves PLN-mediated inhibition of SERCA, thereby increasing SERCA activity and subsequent uptake of calcium. The PLN-SERCA interaction is essential for contraction and relaxation of the heart, and is under the regulation of the $\beta$-adrenergic receptor pathway to adapt cardiac output to physiological needs. \cite{maclennan_2003}

\end{figure*}

Mutations in PLN have a well-established relationship with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) \cite{ref_Eijgenraam}. Besides a recent study \cite{ref_pirruccello}, to the best of our knowledge this gene had not been reported in a GWAS of non-disease phenotypes. In \cite{ref_pirruccello}, PLN was found to be associated with LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDV and LVESV). Interestingly, latent variable $z_0$ yielded a $p$-value lower than the associations reported therein ($10^{-16}$ and $10^{-10}$ for LVEDV and LVESV, respectively). Also, the PLN locus was the only association found for $z_0$, whereas for LV volumes the number of genome-wide significant associations is much higher. 
While this can be regarded as a drawback of our unsupervised approach (since it did not either capture the phenotypic variability associated to those other genetic loci, or detect new ones), our results also suggest that the method allowed to more accurately pinpoint the phenotypic variation associated with PLN. 

Also interestingly, the shape variation associated with high positive values of $z_0$ follows the usual cardiac remodelling linked to DCM \cite{ref_dcm}

\textcolor{purple}{The hypothesis that the PLN association with LV volume is actually mediated by a morphological change captured by $z_0$ was tested. To do this, LV volume was tested in GWAS after being adjusted for $z_0$, however the PLN association remained significant (see supplementary material), suggesting that PLN controls these phenotypes independently.}

% UNSCALED MESHES
For unscaled meshes, several genome-wide significant associations were found, after further adjusting the $p$-value threshold for the number of latent variables tested ($n_z=8$ in this case). As observed for scaled meshes, all the associations belonged to a single latent variable, which we will call $z_1$. The Manhattan plots and synthetic shapes produced by varying $z_1$ around the mean shape are displayed in figure \ref{fig:manhattan_LV_latent_unscaled}. Visual inspection of the effect of varying $z_1$ on the reconstructed LV shape indicates that the most salient feature is a change in mitral orientation.

% Notably, the strongest SNP association ($p=10^{-13}$) was found in chromosome 5 and had not been reported in the recent GWAS of LV phenotypes \cite{ref_nayaung, ref_pirruccello}. This SNP lies within the coding region of gene ARHGAP26. However, no further evidence was found in the literature supporting that this is the mediating gene. Likewise for the locus in chromosome 8 regarding gene CSMD1 ($p=10^{-10}$). Chromosome 6 contains two significant loci: one of them corresponds again to gene PLN, although with a weaker association this time ($p=10^{-8}$); the other locus is located 20 megabase pairs away from the previous ($p=10^{-9})$. The locus at chromosome 2 ($p=10^{-9}$) has been reported in  \cite{ref_nayaung, ref_pirruccello} and mapped to gene TTN. This gene encodes for protein titin, which is  responsible  for  the  sarcomere  assembly of the myocytes, which determines stretching, contraction and passive stiffness of the myocardium \cite{granzier_giant_2004}. Validation and interpretation of the genetic loci found will require further investigation.

\subsection*{Relation to demographic data}
Spearman correlation of latent variables with demographic data was computed and is displayed in figure \ref{fig:relation_to_demographic}.
Interestingly, for scaled meshes, latent variable $z_4$ is significantly correlated with DBP, SBP, BMI and sex (but not with height), whereas latent variable $z_5$ (linked with PLN) is not strongly linked with any demographic variable.

\subsection*{Relation to traditional cardiac indices}
In order to further characterise the latent variables found, their Spearman correlation with several cardiac indices was computed. These quantities were derived from the cardiac 3D meshes. (Details are explained in the supplementary material.) 
Figure \ref{fig:relation_to_indices} shows the strength of such correlations.
It can be seen that latent variable $z_5$ correlates strongly with sphericity index as was seen in figure \ref{fig:manhattan_LV_latent} for synthetic LV meshes.

\subsection*{Relation to health outcomes}
A $t$-test was conducted to determine whether the latent variables were significantly different for subjects with specific cardiac diseases, as compared to people without such diagnoses. To do this, ICD10 codes provided by the UK Biobank were used. The results are presented in \ref{fig:health_outcomes}.
